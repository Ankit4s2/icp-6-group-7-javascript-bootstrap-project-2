                        Dividing critics and audiences while minting money at the box office, Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal redefines mainstream action in Bollywood. The violent revenge saga directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga (who had earlier courted controversy with Arjun Reddy and its Hindi remake Kabir Singh) finds Kapoor playing Rannvijay Singh, a man burdened by the toxic aggression of his father. But when his authoritarian father’s life is threatened, the morally grey protagonist wreaks havoc in Vanga’s blood-soaked thriller.

                        Dhoom was one of contemporary Bollywood’s first franchises, and its impact can still be felt in the Indian action genre.

The heist thriller ended up igniting a craze for sports bikes in the country and turned John Abraham into a full-fledged star after he played the villainous biker gang leader Kabir Sharma.
